# High-Level Description

The first Siemens use case is in the field of (cooperative) intelligent transportation systems (ITS).
In particular, the use case includes the analyzation of V2X communication messages
with the goal *G1* of detecting undesired traffic events
(accidents, traffic jams) and
the goal *G2* of finding a reconfiguration of traffic light controllers
that ameliorates the effects of the undesired event at least partially.
<!--
Concretely, we aim to improve vehicle throughput compared to an unmodified system
for both accidents and traffic jams.
-->

We distinguish a traffic flow between the states of free flow and
traffic jam, which is extended to a third phase "synchronized flow"
in the three-phase traffic theory [B. Kerner 2002].

Traffic flow can be described by local and global flow variables, where
local variables are measured on a specific location and are for instance:

* Traffic flow count: $q=\frac{n}{T}$, where $n$ is the number of vehicles
  that pass a cross-section and $T$ a unit of time (time interval);

* Traffic density: $k=\frac{n}{X}$, where $n$ is the number of vehicles
  that are on segment of length $X$ at a specific time point;

* Nr of vehicles:  $r=\frac{n}{X}$, where $n$ is the count of vehicles
  on segment  $X$ at a specific time point;

* Average speed:  $s=\frac{o}{X}$, where $o$ is the average speed of all vehicles
  on  on segment $X$ at a specific time point.

Global variables describe for the whole network and are extracted from
the full data, ie., if a full simulation run is possible, such as
produced by traffic simulation tool such as SUMO. They make a good choice for overal
performance measurement. Global variables are for instance:

* Average speed: average speed of all vehicles in a run;
* Average delay:  average delay in ms of all vehicles;
* Nr of stops: number of stops of all vehicles.

Global and local variables only give a snapshot of the traffic flow, hence,
more elaborate models are need to capture the flow over a certain time 
period.
A common classification of models is based on the dimension of representation 
(vehicle or flow based) and the granularity of behaviour 
rules (microscopic vs. macroscopic), which leads to three 
classes of models:

* Macroscopic flow models that use mathematical theories for 
describing the traffic flow. For instance, bottleneck nodes and
 queuing theory are used to calculate the capacity change
 on specific nodes over time.
 
* Microscopic flow models are based on the behaviour of individual vehicles, 
 which may emerge from an internal agent model that reacts on external stimuli 
 such as other vehicles, e.g. a car-following model. These flow models
 also build the foundation of traffic simulations such as SUMO or Vissim.


* Mesoscopic flow models were developed to fill the gap between 
macroscopic and microscopic models, where different levels of 
aggregations are introduced, but also the behaviour of individual 
vehicles or traffic control systems are represented.

# Problem Description

<!--
On the fog side we only have the  problem of detection if a traffic jam has started and ended later.
-->

Now, we outline the main problems that need to be addressed in the ITS use case.
Goal *G1* includes the detection of specific events such a traffic jams, the 
collections of process informations such as traffic statistics. Goal *G1* os the main 
focus of this work, with the aim of the finding of re-configuration strategies 
for signal plans, which increase the traffic flow if applied to specific situation. 
We face the following challenges:

* Traffic can be modelled in different ways, many options of 
representation are available, however, we desire a compromise between 
  level of details and efficient computation of changes;
* Signal plans and changes in the plans have to be modelled in detail, 
where hard and  soft contraints can be occur;
* Changes in signal planes should not be random, but have to be based 
  on one or more "intelligent" optimization strategies.

<!--
Each configuration can be calculated as an independent (one-shot) step without
any preceding knowledge on configurations, as re-configuration step, where the
last phase configuration is the input, and as an iterative configuration, where
only small changes are applied repeatedly.
-->

<!--
## Traffic jam detection

A traffic jam should be detected  locally by analyzing the local traffic flow indicators
based on the streams generated at each intersection.
A single local indicator  is not sufficient to reliably detect a traffic jam, hence we need to measure traffic density
$k$ and average speed at one segment $X$ simultaneously over predefined time span $S$.
If the density traffic is above a threshold and average speed is low over the time span $S$,
 a traffic jam is occurring. $Ss$ has to be long enough,
 otherwise it might misclassify a longer red signal phase as a traffic jam.
-->

<!--

## Configuration of local signal plan 

This problem covers the generation of "optimal" signal plans for a single intersection.
We start with either an empty or previous (default) signal plan (configuration) and aim to
reconfigure this plan to increase (or maximize?) the local traffic flow.


In the previous section we defined the components of a signal plan.
A valid signal plan fulfills the following conditions:

* Time slots for red/green phased cover the full cycletime (e.g., 60s);
* No time slot is below a lower limit (e.g., 3s);
* No of the signal group constraints is violated.

A "good" signal plan unfolds a traffic jam, thus
it should improve the overall throughput (in Nr of vehicles) of
our network. We measure the macroscopic throughput over
a selected period by the following variables:

* Nr of vehicles leaving the network for one time interval $T$;

Note that these variables can be directly extracted from SUMO.

-->

<!--

###  Method: Local heuristics

This heuristics is based on the assumption that an exiting signal plan is well adjusted,
and only needs to be changed temporary to handle a higher throughput
The heuristics is defined as follows:

* Find the incoming lanes with high traffic throughput;
* Extend green phases for this signal group to amount for the full capacity of
  the incoming lanes;
* Shortened green phases of signal groups the (constrained) the extended  signal group;
* After a certain time (or simulation steps), we reinstate the original plan


The local heuristics can be used independently to the global structure
of the road network. However, in many cases the traffic jam is just
propagated to the connected intersection. Thus, we need to extend
the configuration for the full (observed) road network.

-->

After evaluating the possibilites to directly encode a
microscopic flow model, we came to the conclusion that the 
granularity of these model is to fine, which will lead 
to large ASP models. Therefore, we will base our work on
 mesoscopic flow models, which still give us enough modelling power 
to express our problem, but will have smaller models. 

The figure below shows a road network in SUMO with two intersections 
that connect three roads (one horizontal and two vertical) 
with two incoming and two outgoing lanes for each road.

# Mesoscopic Traffic Flow Model

The mesoscopic traffic flow model covers the elements of a microscopic 
and a macroscopic flow model such as 
(1) the static traffic network and intersection topologies, 
(2) dynamic states such as vehicle counts and signal phase states, as well as 
(3) the transformation in the dynamic states. 
It is accordingly composed of a static component defining the road network and local topologies, and a dynamic component defining traffic flow, which is based on 
(a) a time model using a timeline, data items of aggregations, and streams, 
(b) traffic flow generation for different node types, to capture the number of vehicles present at different time points; and 
(c) signal phase plans, to capture the generation of signal phases at different time points.


The figure below shows an extracted mesoscopic flow model of Figure 1,
which includes nodes for intersections, links, sources, and sinks.

![Mesoscopic Traffic Flow Model](flow_model.pdf) 


<!--
The C-ITS domain model describes traffic on a #-shaped street layout with four
intersections as shown in Figure 1.
-->


## Static component

The static traffic model describes the structure of the road network including the roads,
 lanes, intersections, intersection topologies, and traffic control installations such as
  traffic lights (TLs), which have one or more TL signal groups attached. TL controller 
assigns red (for stop) and green (for go) states to signal phases. We assume for our setting
that we have one global TL controller that manages all intersections. The signal phases for
 each signal group are encoded in a “default” signal plan, where the green/red split of a 
 full phase length is defined. 
<!-- Usually, each pair of adjacent incoming lanes has one signal group assigned.-->
The static component of road network (with several intersections) is represented by a directed, labeled graph as follows:

* The nodes represent real entities (e.g., intersections) or virtual (e.g., boundary to external environment) “crossing points”. Every node has a fixed type assigned,
where the type can be a source node, sink node,  intersection node, and link node;

* The edges represent entire lanes or segments of lanes, and define the (possible) traffic flow in the network by connecting the nodes;

* Node and edge labelings and provide contextual information including the 
bottleneck capacity to each node (highest possible throughput of vehicles)
and the maximum load capacity (maximum capacity of vehicles that can simultaneously on 
an edge);

* The traffic flow distribution on intersection nodes, defining the ratio on how 
incoming traffic flow (by vehicles) splits into outgoing traffic flow;

* Implicit denial constraints on intersections to ensure that orthogonal crossing lanes are not in a green phase at the same time point.

The static component is extracted from a given traffic simulation model
(such as one generated by SUMO). A suitable segmentation algorithm has
to provide the following steps:

*  segmentate the road network and reduction 
  it into equi-distant edges,
*  add new source/sink nodes for the boundary of the network, 
*  add link nodes between edges, and
*  reduce each intersections to a single nodes.


<!--

Each intersection connects four roads with two incoming and outgoing lanes for each road.
For the two incoming lane one signal group is assigned.
Further, for each lane we define is geometrical extension (a polygon) and
the connection from in incoming to outgoing lanes. An example lane "i100\_l1" in our model is
described as:

* ``` mapLaneIn(i100_l1) ```
* ``` isPartOf(i100_l8, i100) ```
* ``` hasGeo(i100_l1, "POLY((0 1, 2 1, 2 3, 0 3, 0 1))") ```
* ``` connected(i100_l1, i100_l3) ```



The four signal groups are managed by one traffic light controller,
which assigns red (stop) and green (go) states to signal phases. The
signal phases for each signal group are encoded in a signal plan,
where the green/red split of a full phase length is defined.  Each
signal plan encodes implicit hard constraints regarding the green
phase of adjacent incoming roads.

## Traffic Flow Models

**Microscopic flow model.**

The microscopic for model is represented by three data streams
extracted from the V2X messages or the internal state of  (SUMO)
simulation step.
They include vehicle speed and position, as well as signal phase states, where each data point
has an assigned time stamp $ts$:

* ``` speed(vehicle, speed, ts) ```
* ``` pos(vehicle, point(x,y), ts) ```
* ``` signalPhase(group, state, ts) ```

**Macroscopic flow model.**

![Traffic Flow Model](DynaCon_ITS_FlowModel.pdf) 

The macroscopic flow model is represented by a graph  shown in
Figure 2. This model is derived from the static model with a
lower complexity by:


* Reducing each intersection to a single node and ignore its topology;
* Combine the incoming/outgoing lanes to a one incoming and one
  outgoing edge.

The intersections topology will be indirectly encoded in the flow
calculation, which is introduced below.
Further, we extend the static model with the following changes:

* The limits of the intersection are now represented by source and sink
nodes;
* A partitioning of the lanes into segments of equal length called
"link edge", where the adjacent link edges share a newly added "link node";
* Dynamic information regarding traffic flow and capacity
assigned to each ink edge;
* Dynamic information regarding the outgoing traffic flow of a source
  node that is generated by the node.

The partitioning splits full lanes into individual segments of
similar, which allows us to assign (a) a fixed capacity and (b) the current
traffic flow count (in numbers of vehicles) for the the time interval
(or step) $T$.
The segmentation is a preprocessing step, and creates a graph as depicted in Figure 2. 

We distinguish four different types of nodes regarding traffic flow:

* Source node
* Sink node 
* Intersection node
* Link node

**Encoding in Datalog.**

## Dynamic component

The dynamic component  extends the static component with temporal information 
related to single simulation steps also called time points. The temporal 
information consists of two kinds of streamed data items which might change 
in each simulation step: (a) the number of vehicles (NrV), which is the count of 
vehicles on a specific edge, and (b) the signal phase states (SPS), which is the 
TL status of specific incoming lanes on (intersection) nodes at a specific time point. 
Note that the data includes observed data extracted from the simulation model, 
but also values derived from the extracted data.


The dynamic component includes traffic flow (TF) calculation steps that bring 
dynamicity into our model. It generates NrV data items based on the classes of nodes, 
and assigns them at the next time point to edges in the network. Sink nodes play a 
special role and accumulate the incoming data items, but do not generate data 
items themselves. A TF calculation is performed at each time point and adds for each edge 
in our network the new data items to the data streams. It is based either on the incoming
 edges for intersection and link nodes, or on a predefined generation function for source
  nodes. The result of each node’s calculation are new data items that are propagated to 
the outgoing edges, updating their state. The state of an edge is captured by the set of 
data items attached to it on a specific timepoint. 
Simplest is the calculation of link nodes, as one incoming NrV data item generates 
a single outgoing data item. Intersection nodes are more difficult to handle, 
as incoming data items must be split into more outgoing data items according to 
the TF distribution to the  outgoing edges.
In Figure 3, we illustrate three 
calculation steps for four time points represented by the dotted arrows. 

![Flow Calculation Step](flow_step.pdf) 


Signal phase states (SPS) can be defined similar to TF streams, but only consider 
SPS data items. Signal phase states, shortly signal states, for traffic lights are 
defined in signal phase plans, where we assume that each intersection has one plan 
assigned that covers all the signal groups and lanes of the intersection. 



In Figure 4, we give an example of a signal plan as used in SUMO. The length of a 
full cycle is the sum of durations (60 in our example). Each signal group state is 
shown in state, where “r” , resp., “G”, represents red, resp., green phases for the 
duration. In this encoding, each position is an index and assigns the state to a 
signal group, i.e., the first position defines the state of the signal group for 
first lane. The plan also shows implicit constraints, e.g., that
the groups at position 1-4 and 5-12 should not be green at the same time. 


![Example of SUMO signal plan](signal_plan.pdf) 

<!--


## Traffic flow calculation

The traffic flow in our case is defined by two elements.

First, by the number of vehicles (NRV) that are located on an edge
$l_i$ for a time interval $t_i$, called *traffic (flow) count* (TFC),
where $t_i$ is the interval between the time point of the current
simulation step $T_j$ and the previous step $T_{(j-1)}$.

Second, the traffic flow calculation is performed at each simulation
step $T_j$ for each node $n_k$ based on the incoming edges with a
predefined *average throughput*. The results, the TFCs in each node,
are assigned then to the outgoing edges. Note that if a nodes
connects two edges the calculation is simple, but if it is an intersection
node, the TFC needs to be distributed among the outgoing edges.  Figure
3 illustrates such a calculation represented by the dotted arrow for
three simulations steps.


![Traffic Flow Calculation](DynaCon_ITS_Calc.pdf) 

**Edges.**
As shown in Figure 3 , an edge has two important features, the static attribute of *max
capacity* defining the maximum NRV that are propagated and the already
mentioned TFC at a simulation step.

**Source nodes.**
A source node $sc_{i}$ generates a predefined outflow (in NRV)
for each simulation step, and is defined as:

$f(sc_{i}, T_j)=gen(sc_{i},T_j)$, where $gen(sc_{i},T_j)$ generates, based on
 the predefined throughput taken from traffic statistics over a longer time, the NRV
entering the network at node $sc_{i}$ for time step $T_j$.

Note that the outflow can be defined as continuously generation of the same NRV, but also a
could be defined by a stochastic  function.

**Link nodes.**
A link node $lk_{i}$ propagates the incoming flow (in NRV) from
the origin node to the destination node as:

$f(lk_{i}, T_j)=max_{lk_i}(f(e, T_j))$, where $max_{lk_i}$ is the (predefined)
maximum throughput (thus the upper  bound) of a node propagated from
a (single) incoming edge of $lk_{i}$ and $T_j$ a time step.

**Sink nodes.**
A sink node counts the NRV  leaving the network for for
one simulation step, and is defined like a link node with the
addition that it logs these numbers over time.


**Intersection nodes.**
An intersection node $ic_i$ aggregates the different incoming flows from the
connected incoming edges, and distributes them to the outgoing flows
according to a predefined ratio. If a signal phase of an incoming edge
is red, the flow is (expectably) zero.  It is defined as:

$$ f(ic_i, T_j) = \sum_{e \in inc_{ic_i}} f(e, T_j) \cdot w_e \cdot \lbrack phase(e, T_j) = green \rbrack $$,
where $inc_{ic_i}$ represents all incoming edges of $ic_i$, $w_e$ is a weight describing the ratio of traffic flow (usually 1), and $phase(e) = green$ states that $e$ has currently a green signal phase assigned.



**Encoding in Datalog.**
```

% Encode flow as HEX plug-
outflow(X, &flow_calc_src(X,T), T+1) :- sourceNode(X), timeStep(T).
outflow(X, &flow_calc_lnk(X,T), T+1) :- linkNode(X), timeStep(T).
outflow(X, &flow_calc_ins(X,T), T+1) :- intersNode(X), timeStep(T).
result(X, &flow_calc(X,T),T) :- sinkNode(X), timeStep(T).

```

## Signal plans 



We assume in our model that each intersection has an individual
controller with one assigned signal plan.
As shown in Figure 4, a signal plan is made of the following components:

* A fixed cycle-time (e.g., 90s);
* A timeline covering the cycle-time for each signal group, where
  red/green phases have alternating time slots;
* A list with pairs of signal group constraints, which are not allowed
  to be green at the same time.

![Example Signal Plan](SignalPlan.pdf) 

A signal group regulates the traffic for one incoming edge, but it
is often the case that more than one edge is handled. For instance,
two edges that face each other might have the same signal group
assigned. Note that we treat a yellow phase as red phase for
reducing the possible states to two.


**Encoding in Datalog.**
```

mapSignalGroup(i100_sg1).
hasSignalGroup(i100_l1, i100_sg1).

signalPhase(i100_sg1, 'R', 1).
signalPhase(i100_sg1, 'G', 5).
...


```

The above encoding only defines that existence of signal plans,
and the stream actual phase states, which are generated according to the plan.
We outline two options how to represent a full signal plan:

* Implicit encoding in an external (SUMO) file, which is used by an
external (plug-in) atoms;
* Explicit encoding in Datalog, where each signal group and phase
length is represented.

-->

##  Encoding in Datalog

We  illustrate the ASP encoding for the signal plan optimization. 
The encoding is divided into two programs $P_I$ , which contains the 
data encoding, and $P_G$, which contains the guess-and-check problem 
encoding. 

We start with the ASP encoding of the traffic network graph, 
where nodes are represented by predicates $node\_src$ for a source node; sink, link, and 
intersection nodes are encoded similarly. The predicate  $link$ is used to define
each edges of the graph and is used to constructs the structure of the traffic network. 
The label functions bottleneck $l_V$, resp., load capacities $l_E$
are used to assign the maximum flow in a node, resp., the maximum capacity of an edge.
In our examples these functions are uniform, hence the constants $const \; max\_capacity$ 
and $const \; threshold\_red$ are used.
Traffic distribution in intersection nodes is modelled with the predicate
 $ratio(n1,n2,r)$, where $n1$ is the incoming and $n2$ the outgoing edge and 
$r$ is the percentiles of the total nr. of vehicles moving from $n1$ to $n2$.
Safety conflicts for traffic light phases are modelled using 
$conflict(J, X, Y )$, stating that signal phase for the lanes $X$ and $Y$ are 
not allowed to be green simultaneously.

# Progress Report on Integration

We recall the elaborated integration of fog side, where the stream reasoner is located, 
and the cloud side, where the configurator is located:
First, every re-configuration of signal plans is triggered by events 
detected by the stream reasoner that monitors the traffic flow. 
Second, the mentioned streamed data items (by nr. of vehicles) are 
created also be the stream reasoner by aggregating the raw stream data, 
whereby the data items are sent using the process information channel. 
Third, the result of the re-configuration is fed directly to the signal controllers
on the fog side.

Since a full integration of the above three steps is a lengthy task and needs 
the full development of all involved components, i.e., a stream reasoner for monitoring,
a communication platform that support all  channels, a controller that 
manages the re-configuration, and an extension of the signal controller to 
update new signal plans.
Hence, we report on an initial implementation, where we materialize all the 
streamed data items based on the output of SUMO simulation. This is performed 
as a preprocessing step and postprocessing step, where the results are fed 
back the to SUMO simulation, which currently triggers a restart of the simulation.
Note that we plan to provide a full integration, where the pre- and postprocessing
is happening while the simulation is running.

The initial implementation allows us to perform a first set of experiments, which
includes the evaluation of the mesoscopic traffic flow model and 
should prove that reconfigurations based on this model lead to an increase in traffic flow. 


# Test Environment and Experiments

The test environment is based on the traffic simulation SUMO, which builds
the input the data for the static model and parts of the dynamic model.
We also use SUMO for conducting the initial experiments, which 
should show that the mesoscopic traffic flow model approximates a 
SUMO simulation sufficiently.


<!--
# Test Plan for Foundations
-->

## Test Approach

Every use case instance $`I`$ comprises information about: 

* Use case maps/road topologies: lanes, their lengths, crossings, positions of traffic lights, signs, etc.
* Initial traffic situation, which is described by settings of car spawn points, e.g. number of cars generated per time interval, 
random seeds for generators, routes of cars, dynamic conditions (parking), etc. 
* Strategy regulating traffic conditions, e.g. timers of traffic lights, temporary road signs, etc., during the simulation run.

There are two approaches to evaluation of use cases: static and dynamic.
The workflow of in the static case is as follows:

1. Given a use case instance $`I`$ SUMO executes the simulation and outputs an event log
2. The log together with the instance $`I`$ is provided to the reconfigurator which outputs a strategy $`S`$ and a start time point $`T`$ 
3. SUMO takes the instance, starts the simulation using the strategy defined in the instance and changes it to $`S`$ starting from $`T`$  

Detection of events in this case is performed by a stream reasoner on the fog side, 
which allows us to query, e.g., an average number of cars or their average speed in some lane within a given time interval. 
The aggregated data is then provided to a decision component (cloud side), such as Ticker or similar, which makes a decision if some complex event, e.g. an traffic congestion or an accident, is observed. 

Opposite to the static case the dynamic one acts during the simulation. That is, SUMO should periodically output logs to the database and query for a new strategy. The workflow suggests that the event recognition and reconfiguration run in parallel to the simulation and can periodically influence the decision strategy of SUMOs.

## Test Cases

The idea of the test cases is to understand the nature of SUMO simulations and the actions which can influence the traffic situation during the simulation.

### [TC1] Reproducibility of Evaluation Method: Determinism and Seed of Simulation

The SUMO simulation tool is essential for evaluation of all use cases,
and in this test case it is the only part of the representation (model) of the domain
that we want to test.

Preparation: identify a map and initial configuration that produces a traffic jam.

Test procedure:

1. Run this map and this traffic configuration 100 times in SUMO and record the log,
   starting with

>  (i) the same initial random seed, and with
>  (ii) different initial random seeds.

2. Compare the correspondence between the logs to quantify how much randomness influences the result.

3. The test is successful if with same random seed we achieve the same resulting log over all runs, and if with non-synchronized random seed we achieve

>  * a standard deviation of less than X cars/sec of car throughput over all runs,
>  * a standard deviation of less than X km/h of average car speed over all runs,
>  * a standard deviation of less than X cars/sec in standing state over all simulation runs.


### [TC2] Reproducibility of Evaluation Method: Influencing Traffic Lights: Predefined

Influencing traffic light controllers in SUMO is essential for evaluation
of all use cases.
This test case verifies that we can do this in a reproducible way.

Preparation: identify a map and initial configuration with a bit of traffic jams
and build a traffic light controller module M that can modify the switching plan
of one or all traffic lights.

Test procedure:

1. Run this simulation starting from the same random seed and record the log

>  (i) without traffic light influencing module,
>  (ii) with M setting all traffic lights to red,
>  (iii) with M doubling the length of the green phase of one traffic light of one lane L,
>  (iv) with M halving the length of the green phase of one traffic light of one lane L.

2. Compare parameters of the simulations to see which effect the module had.

3. The test is successful if 

>  * Car throughput is lowest in (ii).
>  * Car throughput over the lane L is higher in (iii) than in (i).
>  * Car throughput over the lane L is lower in (iv) than in (i).


### [TC3] Reproducibility of Evaluation Method: Influencing Traffic Lights: Online

Influencing traffic light controllers while the simulation is running
would be the most realistic way of evaluating the use case.
This test case verifies that we can do this in a reproducible way.

Preparation: as in TC2 but prepare a traffic light controller module M
that has some API from which an external tool can modify the switching plan
without predefining it before the simulation starts.
Also some API call should exist in SUMO to run simulation until time step X
and then wait (to interact with M) and then continue the simulation
after M has done the required changes.

Test procedure:

1. Run this simulation 10 times starting from the same random seed and record the log

>  (i) without interacting with M,
>  (ii) without interacting with M but freezing time after step T, waiting 1 second, and continuing,
>  (iii) with freezing time after step T, injecting the same change as in TC2 (iii) and continuing simulation,
>  (iv) with freezing time after step T, injecting the same change as in TC2 (iv) and continuing simulation.

2. Compare parameters of the simulations to see which effect the module had.

3. The test is successful if 

>  * Standard deviation of car throughput is below X in the logs of (i), the logs of (ii), and the logs of (i)+(ii),
>  * standard deviation of car throughput over the lane L is below X in (iii) and (iv), and
>  * car throughput over the lane L is higher in (iii) than in (i) and lower in (iv) than in (i).


## Experiments

The experiments evolve with the progress of our implementation. 
We update this section and add results of new experiments on-going.
Furthermore the encodings an logs are available at the webpage 
http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/ projects/loctrafflog/pais2020.


### [TC1] Reproducibility of Evaluation Method

In the first experiment, we aim to show that SUMO simulations 
run are deterministic, if the same initialization seed is used.
 For this, we conducted a set of experiments,
where we compare the simulation output of 
(a) restarting the simulation 100 times with the same seed,
and (b) restarting the simulation 100 times with random  seeds.
From this experiment, we can conclude that the same seed leads to 
the same simulation output, and if a change in seeding occurs, 
also the result of the simulation output changes.


### [E1] Mesoscopic Flow Model compared to SUMO Simulations

This experiment has as the aim of evaluating the quality of our mesoscopic 
flow model, which we encoded in ASP. For this, we use an experimental setting with
 a predefined traffic network (show in Figure 1) and the following traffic patterns:
 
 * light (few vehicles), 
 * medium (more vehicles with free flow), and
 * heavy   (traffic jam) traffic. 
 
 This setting was used to conduct 100 runs with SUMO and 
 100 runs with the ASP-based model, where the traffic throughput in terms of
 nr. of vehicles over a fixed period was compared. The results indicate 
 that  ASP-based model approximates the SUMO simulation with a deviation of about 10%.
 Interestingly, the deviation seems higher with the low traffic patterns, since a 
 single vehicle could lead to a larger deviation.

# Detailed Use Case Problem 1: Resolve Traffic Jam by Dynamically Reconfigured "Green Wave"

## Models

As described above.

## Test Data

* Car influx and goal configuration(s)

> Notation: first position indicator addresses the side of the "#" grid,
> while the second position indicator addresses the road on that side,
> e.g., the "top left" road is the left road one on the top side of the "#",
> and the "left top" road is the top road on the left side of the "#".

>  * C1: static nonoverlapping routes (easily resolvable)
>
>>   * static routes where cars come in at the top left road
>>     and aim to reach one of the bottom outgoing roads
>>   * static route where cars come in at the top right road
>>     and aim to reach the right top outgoing road
>>   * rationale: it is possible to configure traffic lights
>>     in a way that no car routes cross (green wave)
>
>  * C2: static overlapping routes (partially resolvable)
>
>>   * static routes where cars come in at the left bottom road
>>     and aim to reach one of the bottom outgoing roads
>>     (without using the top crossings)
>>   * static routes where cars come in at the top left road
>>     and aim to reach one of the right outgoing roads
>>     (without using the bottom left crossing)
>>   * rationale: it is possible to permanently set all crossings except bottom right
>>     to a green wave which can resolve traffic jams if only few cars want to reach
>>     either bottom right or right bottom outgoing road
>
>  * C3: static overlapping routes (not resolvable)
>
>>   * static route where cars come in at the left top road
>>     and aim to reach the right bottom road
>>   * static route where cars come in at the top left road
>>     and aim to reach the bottom right outgoing road
>>   * rationale: if traffic on both routes is the same,
>>     a green wave would create more traffic than permanent switching

## Knowledge Bases (and related)


* GridInfo: OWL/SQL/ASP representation of "#" roads, lanes, traffic lights

* TrafficQuery: stream reasoning queries to detect traffic intensity

>  * purpose 1: statistics for generating traffic jam events (triggering reconfiguration)
>  * purpose 2: statistics for evaluating reroutability (performing reconfiguration)

* JamRules: classifies traffic jam start/finish events based on TrafficQuery

* RelevanceRules: classifies relevance of incoming events

* ReconfigRules: aims to find a traffic light configuration that route the majority of cars out of the map, with the potential output of "no viable solution found"

Reasoning with all KBs should be fast (and streaming), only ReconfigRules is slow (and nonstreaming).
